    "a) Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, reason, learn, and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It involves the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: One of the popular examples of artificial intelligence is a virtual personal assistant like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa. These assistants can understand natural language commands, answer questions, and perform various tasks like setting reminders, sending messages, or making appointments based on the user's voice commands.\n",

    "b) Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The primary goal of machine learning is to allow computers to automatically learn and adapt from patterns in data and make predictions or decisions without human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: An example of machine learning is email spam filtering. The algorithm can be trained on a large dataset of labeled emails (spam and non-spam). It learns from the features of these emails (e.g., keywords, sender information) and then can classify incoming emails as spam or not spam based on what it has learned from the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Deep Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that involves the use of artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems. These neural networks consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that can automatically learn representations of data through a hierarchical approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Image recognition is a common application of deep learning. A deep learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), can be trained on a large dataset of images with corresponding labels. It learns to identify patterns and features in images and can then classify new images into different categories (e.g., objects, animals, people) with high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Artificial Intelligence is the broader concept of simulating human intelligence in machines, Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms learning from data, and Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn complex representations of data. Each of these technologies has its own applications and plays a crucial role in shaping the future of various industries."

However, to evaluate the model's performance and assess its ability to generalize to new, unseen data, we need to use separate datasets for training, testing, and validation. These datasets are known as the train, test, and validation sets, respectively.\n",

Unsupervised learning methods for anomaly detection excel in cases where anomalies are not explicitly known and can be detected based on their deviation from the majority of the data, making them valuable tools in various real-world applications such as fraud detection, intrusion detection, and equipment failure detection."
